# How to Create FiveM Assets with Sollumz 2.8.0: Complete Beginner's Guide

> **Free beginner's guide to creating FiveM assets with Sollumz 2.8.0 and Blender.**  
> Learn setup, basic building creation, materials, and the new native binary format support.

Sollumz 2.8.0 changed everything for FiveM asset creation. The new native binary format support means you can skip the XML conversion nightmare and work directly with GTA V's file formats. But here's the problem: most tutorials are still stuck on 2.7.0, and the 2.8.0 changes aren't documented anywhere useful.

This guide fixes that. I'll walk you through setting up Sollumz 2.8.0 properly, creating your first building, and getting it into FiveM. Everything here is tested, current, and actually works. No outdated workflows, no broken steps.

## What's New in Sollumz 2.8.0?

The big change is **native binary format support**. Sollumz 2.8.0 can now directly import and export GTA V's native binary formats (`.ydr`, `.ydd`, `.ybn`, `.ytyp`, `.yft`) without requiring XML conversion. This is powered by PyMateria, the Python bindings for the Materia library developed in collaboration with Rockstar Games and Cfx.re.

What that means for you: no more exporting to XML, opening CodeWalker, converting files, and hoping nothing breaks. Just **File > Export > Sollumz**, choose your format, and you're done. It's faster, simpler, and way less error-prone.

There's also automatic shattermap generation for vehicle windows (we'll cover that in the full guide), better collision handling, and improved MLO support. But the binary format support is the game-changer.

## What You'll Need

First things first, you'll need **Blender 4.0 or higher** installed. If you're starting fresh, I'd actually recommend grabbing **Blender 5.0** if it's available—it plays really nicely with Sollumz 2.8.0. You can download it from [blender.org](https://blender.org) if you don't have it yet.

Next up is **Sollumz 2.8.0**. Head over to the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/Sollumz/Sollumz/releases/tag/v2.8.0) and grab the latest version. When you install Sollumz, you'll also need something called **PyMateria**. Don't worry about downloading it separately—Sollumz will ask you if you want to install it automatically when you first enable the add-on. Just say yes!

> **📝 About PyMateria**  
> PyMateria is a required dependency that powers Sollumz 2.8.0's native binary format support. When you first enable Sollumz, you'll get a prompt asking if you want to install it—definitely click "Yes"! Currently, PyMateria is only available on Windows. If you're on Linux or macOS, you can still use Sollumz, but you'll need to use the XML export workflow (`File > Export > CodeWalker XML`) until PyMateria support is added for those platforms.

## Installing Sollumz in Blender

1. **Download Sollumz 2.8.0** from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/Sollumz/Sollumz/releases/tag/v2.8.0). Don't unzip it—Blender wants the ZIP file as-is.

2. **Open Blender** (make sure you're on version 4.0 or higher).

3. **Go to Edit > Preferences** to open the preferences window.

4. **Click the "Add-ons" tab** at the top, then look for the **"Install..."** button.

5. **Navigate to where you saved the Sollumz ZIP file** and select it. Blender will install it for you.

6. **Enable the add-on**: Look for "Sollumz" in the add-ons list and check the box next to it. This is when you'll get that prompt about PyMateria—go ahead and click "Yes" to install it automatically. This is crucial because PyMateria is what enables the direct binary format support.

7. **Save Preferences**: Make sure to click **"Save Preferences"** at the bottom of the preferences window. This ensures Sollumz stays enabled even after you restart Blender.

## Getting Familiar with Sollumz

Once Sollumz is installed and enabled, you'll notice some new things in Blender:

- **Sollumz Tools Panel**: The main tool you'll be using, found in the sidebar. If you don't see the sidebar, just press `N` to toggle it. This panel is where most of the Sollumz magic happens—converting objects, creating materials, setting up collisions, all that good stuff.

- **Sollumz Pie Menu**: Access by pressing `V` in the 3D viewport. This gives you quick access to common operations without having to dig through menus.

- **File Menu Options**: You'll now see new import and export options. The big one is **File > Import/Export > Sollumz**, which lets you work directly with native GTA V binary formats (`.ydr`, `.ydd`, `.ybn`, `.ytyp`, `.yft` files). This is the new hotness in 2.8.0—no more XML conversion needed!

**Important**: Set up your Blender project with real-world scale right from the start. GTA V uses a scale where 1 Blender unit equals 1 meter, so make sure your scene is set up that way. You can check and adjust this in Blender's scene properties.

## Creating Your First Building (YDR)

YDR files (short for "Drawable") are the bread and butter of GTA V asset creation. They're the standard format for static objects and buildings—basically anything that doesn't move or have complex interior logic. Creating one is pretty straightforward once you know the steps.

### Step 1: Prepare Your Model

Start by creating or importing your 3D model in Blender. This is where your artistic vision comes to life. Make sure your model is properly UV-mapped for texturing—you'll thank yourself later when you're applying materials.

Once you've got your geometry sorted, there are a couple of housekeeping tasks:

1. **Apply all transformations**: Select your model and press `Ctrl+A`, then choose "All Transforms" from the menu. This locks in your scale, rotation, and location, which is important for GTA V.

2. **Center the origin**: Right-click and go to **Set Origin > Origin to Geometry**. This ensures your building will be positioned correctly when you place it in the game world.

### Step 2: Convert to Drawable

Now comes the fun part—converting your model to a drawable:

1. Select your 3D model in the viewport
2. Head over to the **Sollumz Tools panel** (press `N` if you don't see it)
3. Navigate to **Drawable > Create Drawable Objects**
4. Click **"Convert to Drawable"**

You'll see a new empty object appear in your outliner called "Drawable", and your selected objects will become Drawable models as children of this parent object. This hierarchy is important—it's how GTA V organizes drawable assets.

## Materials and Textures

A building without materials is like a skeleton without skin—technically there, but not very appealing. This is where you make your building look like it belongs in GTA V.

### Creating a Shader Material

1. Select one of your Drawable Models
2. Head to **Sollumz Tools > Drawable > Shader Tools**
3. Search for **"NORMAL"** (the workhorse shader for most building surfaces)
4. Click **"Create Shader Material"**

This creates a material that GTA V understands. The NORMAL shader handles diffuse color maps and normal maps, which is perfect for most building surfaces.

### Assigning Textures

1. Switch to Blender's **Shading tab**
2. Connect your texture files to the material
3. In the **Sollumz Texture Parameter panel**, check the **"Embedded"** box—this includes your textures directly in the YDR file, which means you don't have to worry about separate texture files when you export
4. For each texture, set the appropriate usage:
   - `diffuse` for your color maps
   - `normal` for normal maps
   - etc.

### Texture Best Practices

- **Use DDS format** with mipmaps—it's what GTA V expects and it performs better
- **DXT1** for opaque textures
- **DXT5** for textures with transparency

> **💡 Choosing the Right Shader**  
> GTA V has a whole library of shaders, but you'll mostly use a handful:
> - **DEFAULT** for basic surfaces without textures
> - **NORMAL** for standard surfaces with diffuse and normal maps
> - **NORMAL_SPEC** when you need specular highlights
> - **SPEC** for metallic surfaces
> 
> Don't overthink it—use the simplest shader that does what you need.

## Adding Collisions

Right now, your building looks great, but players would just walk right through it. That's where collisions come in. Collisions are invisible meshes that define what players and objects can actually interact with. Think of them as the "solid" version of your building—same shape, but optimized for physics calculations.

### Step 1: Create a Collision Mesh

1. **Duplicate your model**: Select it and press `Shift+D`
2. **Clear parent**: Press `Alt+P` and choose **"Clear Parent and Keep Transformation"** to separate it from the drawable hierarchy
3. **Simplify the mesh**: Remove decorative details, trim down the geometry. Collisions don't need to be as detailed as your visual model; they just need to match the overall shape
4. **Rename it**: Something clear like `your_model_col` so you know what it is

### Step 2: Convert to Collision

1. With your simplified collision mesh selected, head to **Sollumz Tools > Drawable > Collision > Create Bounds**
2. Click **"Convert to Composite"**

This creates the proper collision hierarchy that GTA V expects. Make sure to remove any existing materials from the collision mesh—collisions don't use visual materials.

### Step 3: Assign Collision Material

1. Select your collision mesh in the hierarchy
2. Go to **Sollumz Tools > Drawable > Collision**
3. Click **"Create Collision Material"**
4. Choose the appropriate material type from the dropdown:
   - **CONCRETE** for concrete surfaces
   - **METAL** for metal
   - **WOOD** for wood
   - etc.

This isn't just cosmetic; different materials affect physics, audio, and visual effects.

### Step 4: Embed the Collision

1. Select your collision hierarchy
2. Hold `Shift` and also select your Drawable object
3. In the Outliner, shift-drag the collision hierarchy underneath the Drawable

This parents the collision to the Drawable, embedding it into the YDR file. When you export, the collision will be included automatically.

> **⚠️ Alignment is Critical**  
> Make absolutely sure your collision mesh is properly aligned with your visual model. If they're off even slightly, players will experience weird physics—walking through walls, floating above floors, or getting stuck on invisible barriers. Take the time to verify alignment before exporting.

## Exporting Your Building

With Sollumz 2.8.0, exporting is dead simple:

1. Select your Drawable object (the parent, not the individual models)
2. Head to **File > Export > Sollumz**
3. Choose **YDR (Drawable)** from the format dropdown
4. Make sure your game version is set correctly (Legacy Gen8 or Enhanced Gen9)
5. Click **"Export Sollumz"**

That's it. No XML conversion, no CodeWalker, no extra steps. Your YDR file is ready to use.

The exported file will include your model, materials, textures (if embedded), and collision—everything you need. You can now use this YDR file in your FiveM server or convert it further if needed.
